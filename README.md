# Document Similarity

There exists a **plethora of textual data** on the Internet. The is good...because the data can be used to perhaps assist 
machine learning algorithms. This is also bad...because the data may repeat itself sometimes.

I want to examine the bad, particularly in regards to the idea
of deduplication.
